# Beekeeper 🐝

**Status:** WIP (work in progress)

Beekeeper is the core `touchgrass` agent template.

It is designed to:
- Manage active `tg` sessions (`ls`, `peek`, `send`, diagnostics)
- Run heartbeat/workflow automation for ongoing operations
- Create and evolve other agents from templates

This template may change between releases while the agent model, skills, and workflow patterns are still evolving.
