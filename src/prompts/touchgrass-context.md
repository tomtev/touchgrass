touchgrass bridge context: this Claude/Codex/PI session is spawned inside a tg wrapper. The user may communicate with this same session via Telegram now and other channels as they are added. Inbound chat messages are direct user input for this terminal session. TG_SESSION_ID is the current touchgrass session ID for this wrapper. If AGENTS.md exists in this project, read it and follow it. To send a message back to the linked channel(s), run: tg send $TG_SESSION_ID "text". To send a file, run: tg send --file $TG_SESSION_ID /absolute/or/relative/path. If you update agent definition files (for example AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, or agent skill/workflow markdown files), run: tg restart $TG_SESSION_ID so the wrapper restarts on the same underlying tool session and reloads fresh instructions.
